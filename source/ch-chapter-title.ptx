  <title>Introduction To Matrices and Matrix Arithmetic </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> As you will see from the other set of notes, there are two ways of introducing matrices. You
      can either start with solving equations and then look at arithmetic, otherwise you can look
      at the arithmetic first and then solve equations. Both approaches are as good as each other,
      so weâ€™ve given you one of each. You should also notice that this lecture contains an awful lot
      of names and definitions. </p>

      <p>
         <term>Literary Note:</term>    The singular is matrix and the plural is matrices (which is pronounced:
mate-ri-seas).
